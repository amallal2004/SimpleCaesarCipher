# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. The program allows users to input a message, specify a shift number, and choose between encryption or decryption. The resulting encrypted or decrypted message is then displayed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `caesar_cipher.py` file in a text editor or IDE.
3. Change the alphabet variable to the alphabet you want to use.
4. Run the program by typing python caesar_cipher.py in the terminal.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the encryption or decryption direction, enter the message, and specify the shift number.
6. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message based on your input.
7. To exit the program, type 'no' when prompted to continue.


## Notes

- The program only supports lowercase alphabetic characters. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as is.
- The shift number represents the number of positions to shift each character in the alphabet.
- If the shift number is greater than 26, it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.
